      <h2>1. front-end developer</h2>
      <p><b>HTML</b> is the first essential skill for front-enddevelopment. With HTML one can create the structure of UI</p>
      <img src="images/HTML.jpeg" alt="picture of html">
      <p><b>CSS</b> allows you to make HTML pretty and it add it a little bit of style, but not make it alive</p>
      <img src="images/css.png" alt="picture of css">
      <p><b>JavaScript</b> allowsyou to make html and CSS alive. you can start building actions, give elements of your website behavior, create functions, method, objects.</p>
      <img src="images/JS.png" alt="JavaScript picture">
      <p><b>front-end frameworks</b> examples are React.js, Angular, Vue.js</p>
      <h2>2. back-end developer</h2>
      <p>tools used are <b>PHP, Python, C, ruby</b></p>
      <p>Developing server-side logic: Back-end developers write code in programming languages such as Java, Python, or Ruby to handle data processing, authentication, and other server-side tasks.</p>
      <p>Building and maintaining databases: Back-end developers design and manage databases that store and manage the application data, ensuring efficient and secure access to data.</p>
      <p>Creating APIs: Back-end developers create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable communication between different components of the application, allowing for data to be transferred between the front-end and the back-end of the application.</p>
      <p>Implementing security measures: Back-end developers implement security measures such as authentication and encryption to protect user data and prevent hacking attempts.</p>
      <p>Collaborating with front-end developers: Back-end developers work closely with front-end developers to ensure that the server-side components are integrated seamlessly with the user interface and user experience.</p>
      <h2>3. full-stack developer</h2>
      <p>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IDEs are software applications that provide a comprehensive development environment, including code editors, debuggers, and build tools. Examples of popular IDEs include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.</p>
      <p>Version Control Systems (VCS): VCS is a software that allows developers to manage code changes and collaborate on a project. Git is the most popular VCS used by full-stack developers.</p>
      <p>Web Browsers: Web browsers are used to test and debug web applications. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are popular browsers among developers.</p>
      <p>Front-end Frameworks: Front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue provide pre-built UI components and libraries to build responsive and dynamic web interfaces.</p>
      <p>Back-end Frameworks: Back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Django provide pre-built libraries and tools to handle server-side logic, database management, and API development.</p>
      <p>Databases: Databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are used to store and manage data.</p>
      <p>Cloud Platforms: Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provide infrastructure and services for deploying, scaling, and managing web applications.</p>
      <p>APIs: APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for different systems to communicate and exchange data. Full-stack developers often work with APIs to integrate different parts of a web application.</p>
